    "\n",
    "1.    If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the array with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, either array with shape equal to 1 in a given dimension is stretched to match the other shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither has shape equal to 1, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of this happens without ever actually creating the expanded arrays in memory! This broadcasting behavior is in practice enormously powerful, especially given that when NumPy broadcasts to create new dimensions or to 'stretch' existing ones, it doesn't actually duplicate the data. In the example above the operation is carried out as if the scalar 1.5 was a 1D array with 1.5 in all of its entries, but no actual array is ever created. This can save lots of memory in cases when the arrays in question are large. As such this can have significant performance implications."
