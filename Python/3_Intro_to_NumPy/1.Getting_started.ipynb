    "An array can be thought of as a store of boxes that each holds a single item of data. The boxes can be stacked in multiple dimensions and can range from a single box, a single row of boxes, a single column of boxes, a wall of boxes, to a grid of boxes. An array is a single variable with a single name but each of the boxes within it can be accessed individually or in combination through indexing. The image below shows arrays of varying dimensions, note that there is no limit to the number of dimensions an array can hold, but it becomes impossible to draw them!\n",

By default the type assigned to these arrays is `float64`, but this can be altered using the argument `dtype`, e.g. including `dtype=np.int16` will assign the elements of the array to integers.\n",
