    "- Review fewer than 200-400 lines of code (LOC) at a time:\n",
    "- Optimal results are achieved if this amount of code is reviewed over a period of ~1 hour\n",

    "The reviewee should:\n",
    "- ensure all tasks and features described in the code changes have been implemented, documented and tested before review.\n",
    "- check that changes unrelated to the current code changes are not part of the review.\n",
    "- ask someone to review the code\n",
    "- provide a link to the code and any other relevant information, e.g. how to build the documentation, how to run the tests (including how to set up the environment)\n",

    "The reviewer:\n",
    "- can request a pair review with the reviewee if they feel they need more information after an initial look at the code\n",
    "- spends ~1 hour at a time to review 200-400 LOC\n",
    "- repeats the previous step for reviews containing more than 200-400 LOC until all code has been reviewed:\n",
    "    - if the review consists of 1000 LOC, one approach is to spend 1 hour a day for three days performing the review\n",
    "- presents the review to the reviewee via the ticket, wiki pages, e-mails, or in person, as appropriate, and should:\n",
    "    - refer to the coding standards\n",
    "    - be prepared to offer constructive criticism on the code (not on the developer!)\n",
    "    - make positive comments oriented to improving the code\n",
    "    - ask questions rather than make statements; \"What was the reasoning behind this approach?\"\n",
    "        - avoid phrases like \"Why didn't you do x?\", which can come across as personal attacks\n",
    "        - do not make personal comments about the developer\n",
    "\n",
    "The reviewee should:\n",
    "- accept criticism in a constructive way\n",
    "- make changes to the code based on the reviewer's recommendations\n",
    "- document the important points from the review about why things were done (or not done) for whatever reasons for future reference\n",
    "- take steps to update the coding standards appropriately\n",

    "A sample checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code review:\n",
    "    - do the code changes match the aims described in the code change request?\n",

    "    - have reasons for choosing a particular implementation been documented for future reference?\n",
    "    - is the code easy to understand?\n",
    "    - has duplicate code been avoided?\n",

    "    - does the code handle errors appropriately?\n",
    "    - does the code comply to the coding standards?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test review:\n",
    "    - have tests been included?\n",
    "    - do the tests demonstrate that the objectives of the code changes have been achieved?\n",
    "    - are the tests appropriate for the code?\n",
    "    - can the unit tests be executed?\n",
