    "The first step in building a statistical model is to understand your data and to generate hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the structure of the data?**\n",
    "It is important to understand the structure of the data because different variables must be modelled using different techniques.\n",
    "- Continuous data can take on any value between a defined range, for example temperature\n",
    "- Categorical data can only take on certain values, for example counts such as the number of wet days or named states such as age and gender. Categorical data that is ordered, such as high, medium, low is termed `ordinal` and categorical data with no order such as male, female is termed `nominal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the data vary within itself?**\n",
    "There are two aspects to variability related to how the values in a dataset may change from measurement to measurement. \n",
    "- calibration uncertainty: how much will the same measurement vary if taken again under the same conditions\n",
    "- natural uncertainty: how big is the range of possible values within the population or sample\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the data vary between variables?**\n",
    "In order to build a statistical model, one variable in a dataset must be related to another variable in the dataset. Understanding that covariation is key, and can be performed using quantitative methods (refer to [the correlation course](2.Correlation.ipynb)) but can also be inferred just by plotting the data from two metrics to identify positive, negative and non-linear relationships as well as parts of the data that have no relationship to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis generation and testing** \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have examined your data you can use it to make an educated guess of how the variables can be fitted into a statistical model that can explain the data. The **null hypothesis** proposes that such a model will not be statistically significant, this is the default position. The **alternative hypothesis** proposes the opposite, that there is a statistically significant relationship in the model. The alternative hypothesis is what is tested with a statistical model when attempting to disprove the null default hypothesis. **Hypothesis testing** uses a portion of the data (known as the **training data**) to generate the statistical model that is then used with the remaining portion of the data (known as **test data** or **validation data**) for **Hypothesis confirmation**. Hypothesis testing and hypothesis confirmation should consist of different samples from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminology**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the variability within the data itself, as described above, no statistical model will ever be 100% accurate. A good model will be able to simulate the **signal** in the data (the relationships between variables) but there will always be **noise** in the data, that does not fit the model exactly, also known as the **residuals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measured variable that a statistical model is trying to explain is termed the **response variable**, and is also known as the **dependent variable** or the **target variable**. The measured variables that will be used to try to explain the response variable are known as the **predictor variables**, and are also known as **independent variables** or the **feature variables**."
