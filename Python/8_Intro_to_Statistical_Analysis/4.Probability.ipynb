    "The normal distribution (also known as the Gaussian Distribution) is the most commonly used distribution to be fit to data. It is symmetrical about the mean with a bell-shaped curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Central Limit Theorem** dictates that the more observations in the data, the more the distribution will look like a normal distribution and the more the probabilility of the event happening will approach the true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Three Sigma Rule** dictates that a certain number of the observations in the data will fall within a certain distance of the mean. For a normal distribution, the Three Sigma rule states that:\n",
    "- 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean\n",
    "- 95% of the data will fall within two standard deviations of the mean\n",
    "- 99.7% of the data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Any observation that is more than three standard deviations from the mean should be treated with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **z-score** is a measure of how many standard deviations away from the mean a given data point is. A z-table of the cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution is used to place the z-score in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an example of weather station data, we may wish to substitute the data from one station to another in the case of missing data at the one you want to use. In order to do this though, it is necessary to confirm that the weather at the replacement station is representative of the weather that the station with missing data. For this example, we want to know whether we can use maximum temperature data from Heathrow to replace missing data from Oxford in July 2012."
